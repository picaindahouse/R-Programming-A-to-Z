# I already know how to code- but there are a few differences
# To assign values to variables don't use = use <-

# Look at Global Environment to see what each value is

# Double: Doubles are what you would use in arithmetic equations
tom <- 5
typeof(tom)
tom + 2

tim <- 2.3

# Integers: For a number to be an integer, put a L behind it
# This signifies that you don't need that number for arithmetic purposes
tam <- 5L

# Characters- basically the same as strings in python
tum <- 'Hey'
typeof(tum)

# Logical- same as True and False in python
# Can be either written as T / F or TRUE / FALSE (All Caps)
tem <- T

tym <- FALSE

# Complex: Like complex numbers in Amath
thm <- 3 + 7i
