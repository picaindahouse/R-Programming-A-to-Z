# Today we will be going through Functions:
# Functions we have learnt so far:

rnorm()

c()
seq()
rep()

is.integer() # all the is. 

typeof()

sqrt()
paste()

# by puttng a ? before a function- you can see what it does and how to use it in diff. ways

?rnorm # Under the help section you can read all the variables you can input

# Thus now I know tha rnorm can have three variables

rnorm(3,10, 5)
rnorm (3, mean = 10, sd = 5)  # Can also specify if you want to be safe


# Thus when you want to use a function, especially for the first time- put the ? before it to learn how to use it properly
